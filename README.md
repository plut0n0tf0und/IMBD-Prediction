## Introduction
Credit card fraud detection is an important task in the financial industry. This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can accurately identify fraudulent transactions. The model will help financial institutions and cardholders in flagging and preventing potential fraud.

## Dataset
We are using a publicly available credit card fraud dataset from [source link] which contains a large number of transactions made by credit cardholders. The dataset is highly imbalanced, with a small fraction of fraudulent transactions.

## Methodology
1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, scaling, and handling class imbalance.
2. Feature Engineering: Creating relevant features for model training.
3. Model Selection: Using various machine learning algorithms and deep learning models.
4. Model Evaluation: Assessing the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. Results: Presenting the results and insights.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/credit-card-fraud-detection.git
